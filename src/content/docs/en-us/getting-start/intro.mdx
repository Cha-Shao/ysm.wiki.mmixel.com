## Basic Introduction

Yes Steve Model is designed with server communities in mind, featuring many server-friendly designs, including:

- Client model auto-sync: When a regular player joins the server, the server will **automatically** sync models to the player's computer.
- Model file encryption: Models sent to the client are **encrypted binary files**, effectively preventing model theft.
- Model permission system: Models can be individually authorized; only after OP grants permission via command can specific models be used.
- Vanilla player model modification: Adds default Steve and Alex models, both of which automatically use the player's skin.
- Animation wheel: Press `Z` to open an animation wheel, making it easy to play various fun animations (such as actions, emotes, etc.).
- Touhou Little Maid mod rendering support: With Yes Steve Model 2.4.0+ and Touhou Little Maid 1.2.0+, you can apply models and animations to maids.

## Platform Support

Versions 1.1.5 and earlier are written in pure Java and support the three major platforms and mobile.

Since Java encryption in older versions is easily cracked, from version 1.2.0 onward, the core encryption and rendering parts are written in C++, greatly improving rendering efficiency and security, but with less multi-platform support.

Currently, the client only supports Windows x64, and the server supports Windows and Linux x64. Support for other platforms and architectures is under development and will be announced as progress is made.
