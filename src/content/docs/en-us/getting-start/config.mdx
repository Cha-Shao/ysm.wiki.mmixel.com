title: Configuration File Guide
---

The Yes Steve Model mod provides multiple configuration files, allowing players to personalize their experience and making it easier for server administrators to manage the server.

## Client Configuration

In the top right corner of the model selection interface, you can open an in-game configuration panel to adjust various client-side options.

To adjust the paper doll in the top left corner, simply press the `Alt P` shortcut (if this shortcut does not work, please check your key bindings).

## Server Configuration

The Yes Steve Model mod has two configuration files: one located at `config/yes_steve_model-common.toml`, and another at `world save directory/serverconfig/yes_steve_model-server.toml` (this file is available from version 2.3.0 onwards).

### Common Configuration (requires server restart)

The configuration at `config/yes_steve_model-common.toml` differs between versions before 2.2.2 and after 2.3.0.

```toml
[general]
    # Whether to show the disclaimer screen
    DisclaimerShow = false
    # Whether to print roulette animation playback info in the chat
    PrintAnimationRouletteMsg = false
    # Whether to disable rendering of your own YSM model
    DisableSelfModel = false
    # Whether to disable rendering of other players' YSM models
    DisableOtherModel = false
    # Whether to disable first-person YSM hand rendering
    DisableSelfHands = false
    # Whether to disable YSM arrow model replacement rendering
    DisableArrowsModel = false
    # Default model ID given to players when they first join the server
    DefaultModelId = "default"
    # Default model texture given to players when they first join the server
    DefaultModelTexture = "default"
    # If you encounter rendering issues when using Optifine, enable this
    UseCompatibilityRenderer = false
    # Global sound volume for animation sounds (added in 2.3.0)
    # Range: 0.0 ~ 100.0
    SoundVolume = 100.0
```

### Server Configuration (no restart required, auto hot-reload)

The configuration at `world save directory/serverconfig/yes_steve_model-server.toml` was introduced in version 2.3.0. In version 2.2.2 and earlier, these settings are found in `config/yes_steve_model-common.toml`.

```toml
[server_scheduler]
    # Number of threads for model processing, 0 means auto
    # Range: 0 ~ 19
    ThreadCount = 0
    # Bandwidth allocated per player when distributing models (unit: Mbps)
    # Range: 1 ~ 999
    BandwidthLimit = 5
    # Timeout for player sync response. Values less than 10 mean auto. (unit: seconds)
    # Range: 0 ~ 120
    PlayerSyncTimeout = 0
    # Whether players can freely switch models
    CanSwitchModel = true
    # Models hidden from the client selection interface, used to hide unwanted default models (added in 2.3.0)
    # Example: ["default", "default_boy", "alex", "steve", "qingluka"]
    ClientNotDisplayModels = []
```
