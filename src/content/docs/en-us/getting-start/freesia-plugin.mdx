**Freesia Plugin is not an official YSM project**. It is released under the

Freesia is a server-side proxy plugin that enables plugin servers to support Yes Steve Model.

Freesia mainly consists of three parts: `Velocity`, `Worker`, and plugin sub-servers with `Backend` installed. `Velocity` is responsible for forwarding and processing YSM packets, `Worker` handles model synchronization and data generation, and the sub-servers are where players play the game.

You can get the latest version of Freesia [here](https://github.com/YesSteveModel/Freesia/releases).

## Velocity

On the Velocity side, there are two key components: `master_control_service` and `msession`.

- `master_control_service`: Used for communication between Velocity and Worker nodes, controlling the behavior of Worker nodes.
- `msession`: Responsible for forwarding players' YSM packets to Worker nodes with the YSM mod installed for cache synchronization.

<Aside>

- Make sure Velocity can connect to the Minecraft port of the Worker server.
- Do not add the Worker server to the Velocity sub-server list, and do not expose the `master_control_service` and `msession` ports to the public network, otherwise there will be security risks.

### Example Configuration File

```toml
[functions]
# Whether to kick players who do not have the YSM mod installed
kick_if_ysm_not_installed = false
# Handshake timeout (milliseconds)
ysm_detection_timeout_for_kicking = 30000

[messages]
# Language option, supports "zh_CN" and "en_US"
language = "zh_CN"

[worker]
# Master control node address
worker_master_ip = "localhost"
worker_master_port = 19200
# Worker server address (should match server-port and server-ip in server.properties)
# Do not expose Worker and master control node ports to the public network, or there will be security risks
worker_msession_port = 19199
worker_msession_ip = "localhost"
```

## Worker

Worker is a **Fabric 1.21 server with YSM and Freesia - Worker mods installed**. It mainly handles YSM logic (such as cache synchronization), entity state updates, and NBT data generation.

To reduce resource usage, most game functions are disabled on the Worker side, and it only processes YSM packets and login phase packets, simulating a MultiPaper-like multi-slave scenario.

Worker **does not execute most game logic or save world data**, but tick logic still exists. Due to YSM logic, the Worker may become a performance bottleneck, but Freesia uses asynchronous processing, so the impact is relatively small.

### Example Worker Freesia Configuration File:

```toml
[worker]
# Must be consistent with Freesia - Velocity configuration
worker_master_ip = "localhost"
worker_master_port = 19200
# Reconnection interval for the control node (seconds)
controller_reconnect_interval = 1
# Player data cache expiration time (seconds)
player_data_cache_invalidate_interval_seconds = 30
```

### Worker server `server.properties` configuration:

```properties
# Must be consistent with Freesia - Velocity configuration
server-ip=127.0.0.1
server-port=19199
```

## Sub-server

The main responsibility of the sub-server is to handle player Tracker check requests from Velocity and notify Velocity to update the player Tracker. Therefore, **the sub-server must have `Freesia - Backend` installed**.

## Example Script

If you are still unsure how to use it, you can get a template file below. You can run `install - freesia.bat` (Windows) or `install - freesia.sh` (Linux) to download the relevant files. After downloading, run `start.bat` or `start.sh` in the corresponding folder to start the server.
