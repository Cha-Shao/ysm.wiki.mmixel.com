Only `png` format textures are supported. It is recommended to minimize the use of **semi-transparent** textures, as stacking many semi-transparent textures may cause some rendering errors.

Since version 2.2.1, as long as the new format is used, texture names are not
restricted and can use any characters.

Just modify the `default_texture` field under `properties` in the definition file `ysm.json`.

If you are using the BlockBench plugin, simply select here:
