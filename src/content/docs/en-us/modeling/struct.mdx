Understanding the project structure of a model pack is a crucial step.

Since both the compressed package format and the ysm format models are converted from the folder format, we will explain using the folder format directly here.

## File Directory Structure

<Aside>
  New features require the new file structure; the old structure does not
  support new features.

<Tabs syncKey="version">

<TabItem label="Version 2.3.0/2.3.1">
  
Version 2.3.0 adds support for audio and animation controllers.

Except for the resource description file `ysm.json`, which has a fixed name and location, custom models, animations, textures, etc. can be placed in different subfolders as needed. Folder names, texture names, etc. can use any characters.

<FileTree>

      - arm.animation.json (file names are unlimited, any characters allowed)

<TabItem label="Version 2.2.1 / 2.2.2">

In older versions, having many files made the structure very messy. Therefore, starting from version 2.2.1, a new file structure was designed, with the `ysm.json` file in the directory managing other resources. The recommended structure is as follows:

Except for the resource description file `ysm.json`, which has a fixed name and location, custom models, animations, textures, etc. can be placed in different subfolders as needed. Folder names, texture names, etc. can use any characters.

<TabItem label="Version 1.2.0 and Earlier">

The folder format model structure is as follows, with only three required parts: `main.json`, `arm.json`, and at least one `png` texture.

Custom models, animations, and textures must all be placed in one folder. Folder names, texture names, etc. can only use lowercase English letters, numbers, and underscores.

<FileTree>

    - info.json (info file, used to display author, name, license, etc. in-game)

    - arm.json (arm model file for first-person arms, fixed name)

## ysm.json File Details

The `ysm.json` file is a resource description file added in version **2.2.1** and later. New models and related configurations use this file as an index.

This file supports the following:

- Set default texture and texture display order;
- Set preview animation to play in the model selection interface (previously always idle);
- Customize the number, order, and names of Extra animations (no longer limited to extra+number);
- Read subdirectory files in the model directory;
- Insert author information, assign avatars, roles, descriptions, and contact info;
- Insert homepage and donation page info;
- Specify PBR textures;
- Wheel animation configuration (added in 2.3.0);
- Wheel animation classification (added in 2.3.0).

`ysm.json` must be placed in the root directory of the model folder and saved with UTF-8 without BOM encoding. The content structure is as follows:
