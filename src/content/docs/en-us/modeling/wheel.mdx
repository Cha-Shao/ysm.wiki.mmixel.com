import ImageCard from "@/components/ImageCard"

Starting from version 2.3.0, the wheel menu supports sub-wheels and allows you to customize configuration buttons.

So how do you write the relevant content?

First, open your `ysm.json` file and find the previous `extra_animation` field. Here is an example for your reference.

A BlockBench plugin will be developed to handle this in the future, but it’s good to get familiar with it in advance.

## Example File

```json
{
  // Find your original extra_animation field and add to it as shown
  "extra_animation": {
    // The old format is still supported, you can ignore it
    "extra1": "Wheel Animation 1",
    // Note the # symbol in the value, which has special meaning
    // It will look for an item with the same id in extra_animation_buttons
    // to add configuration buttons
    "extra2": "#Button1",
    // Note the # symbol at the start, which also has special meaning
    // It will look for animations in extra_animation_classify
    // to open a submenu interface
    "#Category1": "Test Category",
    // Special category wheel, #return is a fixed name, this wheel acts as a return button
    // Added in version 2.3.1
    "#return": "Return Button"
  },
  // This field was not present before, now used to add submenu interfaces
  "extra_animation_classify": [
    {
      // This ID is the content after # above
      "id": "Category1",
      // The format is the same as the extra_animation field above
      "extra_animation": {
        "extra0": "Animation 1",
        "extra1": "Animation 2",
        "extra2": "Animation 3",
        "extra3": "Animation 4"
      }
    }
  ],
  // This feature is rich and is used to add configuration buttons to the wheel
  "extra_animation_buttons": [
    {
      // This ID is the content after # above
      "id": "Button1",
      // Display name, can be anything
      "name": "Any Name",
      // Specific configuration components
      "config_forms": [
        {
          // This is a slider
          "type": "range",
          "title": "Size",
          "description": "Used to change the player's size",
          // The slider will change the molang variable, must specify a variable!
          "value": "v.player_size",
          // No further explanation needed
          "step": 0.1,
          "min": 0.2,
          "max": 5
        },
        {
          // Toggle button
          "type": "checkbox",
          "title": "Toggle Cat Ears",
          "description": "Used to toggle Furina's cat ears",
          // The molang variable to change, must specify a variable!
          "value": "v.neko"
        },
        {
          "type": "radio",
          "title": "Please select the correct answer",
          "description": "Try the effect",
          // When opening the config interface, it reads the value of v.type here,
          // and selects the radio button accordingly;
          // If v.type is 0, the first is selected; if 1, the second; and so on.
          // Only variable names can be filled here, not expressions!
          "value": "v.type",
          // Options, can add as many as you want
          "labels": {
            // The left is the display name, the right is the execution statement (not an assignment statement)
            // Clicking will execute the corresponding statement for calculation!
            "A": "v.type=0;",
            "B": "v.type=1;",
            "C": "v.type=2;",
            "D": "v.type=3;",
            "E": "v.type=4;",
            "F": "v.type=5;",
            "any label": "v.type=6;"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
