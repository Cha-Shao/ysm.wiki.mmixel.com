Starting from version 2.3.0, the Yes Steve Model mod supports calling audio in animations. Please note the following points when using this feature:

- Audio files can be either built into the model pack or reference vanilla game audio.
- For built-in audio, place the files in the `sounds` folder in the root of the model pack (this is the default path).
- Only the new file structure is supported; the old structure does not support audio features.
- The audio format must be **OGG**. It is recommended to use mono for stereo effects in-game.
- A single audio file must not exceed 4MB, and the entire model pack must not exceed 66MB.

<Aside title="How to convert audio? Recommended tools:">

- **Format Factory**: Simple and easy to use, suitable for beginners. Download:

  [Tencent Software Center](https://pc.qq.com/detail/11/detail_1511.html)
- **Adobe Audition**: Professional audio editing software, very powerful but has a steeper learning curve.
- Other tools: Audacity, FFmpeg, etc. As long as they support exporting to OGG format.
- Of course, you can use any other tool that can convert audio to OGG format.

## Steps to Add Audio

<Steps>

1. **Create the audio folder**

   Create a folder named `sounds` in the root directory of your model pack.

2. **Add OGG audio files**

   Only `.ogg` audio files are supported. Other formats must be converted before use.

3. **Add audio to animations in BlockBench**

   Configure audio trigger points in animation keyframes.

## Audio Naming Rules

### 1. Built-in Audio (Custom Path)

**Default path**: `sounds/AudioName.ogg`

- In animation keyframes, just enter the audio file name (no extension or path prefix needed). For example:
  If the audio file is `sounds/AttackSound.ogg`, enter `AttackSound` in the keyframe.

**Custom path**:

If you want to change the audio folder name, add the `sound_path` field in the `properties` section of `ysm.json`:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "sound_path": "CustomFolderName" // e.g., "AudioLibrary"
  }
}
```

- The audio file path then becomes `CustomFolderName/AudioName.ogg`.
- In animation keyframes, still only enter the audio file name (no prefix or extension).

### 2. Vanilla Game Audio

In animation keyframes, directly enter the vanilla audio ID (e.g., `minecraft:block.anvil.hit`) to use built-in game audio.  
If you want to extend vanilla audio, you can do so by creating a resource pack:

<Aside>

It is recommended to use vanilla resource packs for adding audio whenever possible. This reduces the size of your model pack and avoids copyright issues.
