## Main Model

The main model uses a standardized group design. As long as you don't make major changes to the default model's groups, the related animation files will generally be fully compatible.  
After the game runs, the standard model and animation files will be automatically generated in the `config\yes_steve_model\custom\default` folder in the game root directory. You can modify and distribute them as you like.

<Aside type="tip">

To encourage and facilitate the creation of model packs, the models in the
`default` folder are released under the **CC 0 license** and can be freely
modified and distributed.

</Aside>

Certain specific group names are automatically given special functions by the game. **Applying scale, rotation, and translation animations to them can change the size, orientation, and position of the related rendering**:

## First-Person Arm Model

<Aside type="tip">

The first-person hand model currently does not support Bedrock animations, but
is fully compatible with the Eternal Firearms Workshop mod.

</Aside>

The first-person hand model can be created by modifying the main model and shares the same texture. Steps:

<Steps>

1. **Create a new model**

   Start a blank BlockBench project.

2. **Copy arm models**

   Copy only the `LeftArm` and `RightArm` groups from the main model file to the **root** of this project.

3. **Adjust rotation and position**

   Set the `X`/`Y`/`Z` rotation of both `LeftArm` and `RightArm` groups to `0` (no need to modify subgroups; after adjustment, arms should point straight down).

   <Aside type="tip">

   If the arm position is abnormal when using the Eternal Firearms Workshop
   mod, you can fix it by moving the arms down or reducing the distance
   between them.

   </Aside>

</Steps>

Additionally, create a group named `Background` at the root. The game will render it as a background in first-person view, unaffected by held items or use state.  
The final model in Blockbench should look like this:

## Custom Arrow Model

Version 1.2.0 and above support custom arrow models. When the player switches models, fired arrows (including crossbow bolts) will automatically use the custom model; if none, the vanilla arrow is shown.

**Note orientation:** In front view, the arrowhead should point to the left (East).
