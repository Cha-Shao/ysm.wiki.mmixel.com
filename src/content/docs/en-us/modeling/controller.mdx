title: Animation Controller
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

In the past, animation playback conditions were completely hardcoded, and artists could not customize them.

In version 2.3.0, a Bedrock-style animation controller was added, allowing users to customize animation playback conditions.

## Controller Syntax

Simply add the `animation_controllers` field to the `ysm.json` file. Here is an example:

```json {12-14}
"files": {
    "player": {
      "model": {
        "main": "models/main.json",
        "arm": "models/arm.json"
      },
      "animation": {
        "main": "animations/main.animation.json",
        "parcool": "animations/parcool.animation.json"
      },
      // Multiple files can be added
      "animation_controllers": [
        "controller/any_name_is_ok.json"
      ],
      "texture": [
        "textures/texture.png"
      ]
    }
}
```

A controller file can contain multiple controllers. If you wish, **you can also split them into multiple files**, as the program will automatically merge them when reading.

The controller file name is not restricted, but the controllers inside must use specific names, as shown below:

Once you add an animation controller with a specific name, the previously hardcoded controllers will be replaced.

<Aside>

If your BlockBench cannot import animation controllers, try removing the GeckoLib plugin and then re-importing.

The following names are available for use. Their meanings should be clear from the English names, so they are not translated here:

## Added molang Variables and Functions

To make controllers easier to use, we have wrapped some states and directly added molang variables starting with `ctrl` for making animation controllers.

### Variables (all are boolean variables)

| molang                          | Description                                              |

### Functions

Below are several molang functions, which require parameters.

The second parameter is similar to the original animation naming: `$` means item ID, `#` means item tag, `:` means special category.
