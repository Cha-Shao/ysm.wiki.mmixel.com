title: Emote Animation
---

Extra animations need to be stored separately in the `extra.animation.json` file. When using the animation wheel, these animations will play.

Starting from version 2.2.1, there is no longer a limit to the number of extra animationsâ€”you can add as many as you like. If you use the new file format, animation names are also no longer fixed and can be customized.

**Only the first eight emote animations can have custom hotkeys**, which you can add directly in the vanilla keybind settings.

| Name                                       | Function                                                        | Note                                                                                                          |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `extra0`<br/>`extra1`<br/>...<br/>`extra7` | Plays the corresponding extra animation via the animation wheel | Plays according to the loop type set in the animation file<br/>**Since version 2.2.1, names are not limited** |

## How to Set Play Type

If you want the emote animation to play only once or to always maintain a certain animation state, just set the animation's play type to `Play Once/Loop`.

You only need to modify this property in BlockBench: right-click the animation, select the `Properties` menu, and you can open this settings interface:

## How to Disable Walk Interrupt

In YSM version 2.2.2 and earlier, walking would interrupt the emote animation (this was intentional).

From version 2.3.0, a `Lock` button was added to the emote wheel. After clicking, moving or sprinting will not interrupt the emote animation (unless the animation itself finishes).

Since version 2.3.1, a new hotkey `Alt L (default)` was added to quickly enable or disable the lock feature.
