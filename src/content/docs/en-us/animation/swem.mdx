title: SWEM Animation

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

The SWEM equestrian mod is a highly realistic horse-related mod that adds a complete set of equestrian animations, simulating real-life horse movements in the game. Since version 2.2.2, we have added compatibility support for this mod!

You can refer to the MCMOD Wiki: [https://www.mcmod.cn/class/7803.html](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/7803.html)

You can refer to the default model animation file `swem.animation.json`. Also, don't forget to declare this file in `ysm.json`!

## Adding Animation Locator File

First, you need to add a new type `swem` in the animation field of `ysm.json`, as shown below:

```json {9}
"animation": {
    "main": "animations/main.animation.json",
    "arm": "animations/arm.animation.json",
    "extra": "animations/extra.animation.json",
    "tac": "animations/tac.animation.json",
    "carryon": "animations/carryon.animation.json",
    "parcool": "animations/parcool.animation.json",
    // This is the equestrian animation
    "swem": "animations/swem.animation.json",
    "slashblade": "animations/slashblade.animation.json",
    "tlm": "animations/tlm.animation.json"
}
```

After that, refer to the default model's `swem.animation.json` animation.

If you want to modify the equestrian animation, be sure to fill in this field.
If the modified equestrian animation does not take effect, please check
whether this file is declared here.
