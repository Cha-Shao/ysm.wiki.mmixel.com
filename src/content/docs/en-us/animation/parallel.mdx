title: Parallel Animations
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

Parallel animations are mainly divided into two categories: `pre_parallel` and `parallel`. Among them, `pre_parallel` has a lower priority than the main animation and will be overridden by the main animation; while `parallel` has a higher priority than the main animation, **and uses a special blending animation method**.

Parallel animations are also placed in the `main.animation.json` file and are used for animations that should always play regardless of the situation, such as tail and ear swinging, blinking, etc.

You can also add molang scripts in parallel animations to show or hide armor under specific conditions.

| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- |
| `pre_parallel0`<br/>`pre_parallel1`<br/>...<br/>`pre_parallel7` | Independent from the main animation, lowest priority. The priority increases with the number.  | Loops |
| `parallel0`<br/>`parallel1`<br/>...<br/>`parallel7`             | Independent from the main animation, highest priority. The priority increases with the number. | Loops |

<Aside title="What is special blending animation?">
Suppose there are two animations: Animation A bends the arm by 10 degrees, and Animation B bends the arm by 25 degrees, with B having a higher priority than A.
- By default: Animation B will completely override the effect of Animation A on the arm, so the arm bends 25 degrees.
- Special blending animation: The effects of Animation B and Animation A on the arm will be added together, so the arm bends 35 degrees.

This blending method only stacks rotation, and does not affect translation or scaling.
