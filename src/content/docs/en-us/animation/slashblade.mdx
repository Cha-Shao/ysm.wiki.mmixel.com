<Aside>

Since version 2.3.0, we have added compatibility support for the SlashBlade
mod. Now, both the old SlashBlade and SlashBlade: Reforged can use this
animation system.

</Aside>

## Adding New Locator Groups

The old `LeftWaistLocator` is still retained, which will render a complete sword (including blade and sheath). The newly added locator groups `BladeLocator` and `SheathLocator` can render the blade and sheath separately.

<Aside>

- The `BladeLocator` group is recommended to be placed at the right hand position, sharing the same position and rotation point as `RightHandLocator`.

- The `SheathLocator` group is recommended to be placed at the left hand position, sharing the same position and rotation point as `LeftHandLocator`.

- The `LeftWaistLocator` group is recommended to be placed at the left hand position, sharing the same position and rotation point as `LeftHandLocator`.

- The `RightWaistLocator` group can remain unchanged and still be under `UpperBody`.

</Aside>

To execute SlashBlade animations, all these locator groups must exist. Otherwise, the old default animation (i.e., always performing the normal attack animation) will continue to be used.

## Adding Animation Locator File

First, you need to add a new type `slashblade` in the animation field of `ysm.json`, as shown below:

```json {10}
"animation": {
    "main": "animations/main.animation.json",
    "arm": "animations/arm.animation.json",
    "extra": "animations/extra.animation.json",
    "tac": "animations/tac.animation.json",
    "carryon": "animations/carryon.animation.json",
    "parcool": "animations/parcool.animation.json",
    "swem": "animations/swem.animation.json",
    // This is the SlashBlade animation
    "slashblade": "animations/slashblade.animation.json",
    "tlm": "animations/tlm.animation.json"
}
```

After that, you can refer to the default model's `slashblade.animation.json` animation.

<Aside>

**If you want to modify the SlashBlade animation, be sure to fill in this
field. If the modified SlashBlade animation does not take effect, please check
whether this file is declared here.**

</Aside>

## Get the Current Sword Skill Animation Name

In fact, there are not many commonly used SlashBlade animations, about twenty or so. The rest are either not implemented or very hard to trigger.

If you want to know which animation is currently being executed, you can follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Enter the command `/ysmclient molang watch add post "Current SlashBlade Animation" ctrl.slashblade_animation`

2. Open the debug interface by pressing **Alt B** to enable debugging.

3. Trigger a sword skill with SlashBlade, and you will see the current animation name.

</Steps>
