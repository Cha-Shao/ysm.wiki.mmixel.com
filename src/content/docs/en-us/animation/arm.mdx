title: Conditional Arm Animations
---

import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

Conditional animations are a series of animations defined by special naming conventions, which are only triggered and played when specific conditions are met. With this design, developers can quickly achieve the desired interactive effects without needing to deeply understand the animation controller mechanism.

## Conditional Arm Animation Mechanism

Due to the complexity of the arm animation system, we manage it in a separate configuration file.

All **default model** conditional arm animations are stored in the `arm.animation.json` file and will automatically play when the player holds the corresponding item and performs related actions.

These animations have **higher priority than main animations** and will override arm-related animation groups in the main animation. Therefore, **do not add non-arm-related animation groups in arm animations**.

If no specific arm animation is configured, the game will call the default `use_mainhand`, `use_offhand`, `swing_hand`, and other basic animations.

## Vanilla Mechanism Supplement

Below are key concepts from the vanilla Minecraft mechanism:

- **Mainhand**: Default is the right hand, used for primary interactions (such as attacking, using items).
- **Offhand**: Default is the left hand, usually for holding shields or offhand items.
- **Use**: The action triggered when the player right-clicks while holding an item (such as eating, drinking potions, using bows/shields, etc.).
- **Swing**: The action triggered when the player left-clicks, **by default only the mainhand can trigger** (such as attacking, throwing items).
- **Hold**: The state when the player is holding an item but not performing any action (such as idle weapon holding pose).
- **Tag system (Tag)**: Used to categorize similar items (such as all swords). For specific tags, refer to the [Minecraft Tag Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tag).
- **Item ID lookup**: Press `F3 + H` to display item IDs (example below):

## Use Animations

Use animations include **10 built-in categories**, compatible with most mod scenarios. The rules are as follows:

| Animation Name                                       | Trigger Scenario                                    | Duration Description                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `use_mainhand:eat`<br/>`use_offhand:eat`             | Played when eating food                             | About 1.5 seconds                     |
| `use_mainhand:drink`<br/>`use_offhand:drink`         | Played when drinking potions or milk buckets        | About 1.5 seconds                     |
| `use_mainhand:shield`<br/>`use_offhand:shield`       | Played when raising a shield                        | Dynamic trigger, lasts until released |
| `use_mainhand:block`<br/>`use_offhand:block`         | Played when in blocking state (e.g. holding shield) | Loops during blocking                 |
| `use_mainhand:bow`<br/>`use_offhand:bow`             | Played while drawing a bow                          | Recommend ≥60s or static              |
| `use_mainhand:spear`<br/>`use_offhand:spear`         | Played while holding a trident                      | Recommend ≥60s or static              |
| `use_mainhand:crossbow`<br/>`use_offhand:crossbow`   | Played when loading/using crossbow                  | Recommend ≥60s or static              |
| `use_mainhand:spyglass`<br/>`use_offhand:spyglass`   | Played when using spyglass                          | Recommend ≥60s or static              |
| `use_mainhand:toot_horn`<br/>`use_offhand:toot_horn` | Played when blowing goat horn                       | Recommend ≥60s or static              |
| `use_mainhand:brush`<br/>`use_offhand:brush`         | Played when using brush (archaeology)               | Dynamic trigger, during operation     |

### Custom Use Animation Rules

Supports custom animations via **item ID** or **tag**. Example:  
| Animation Name | Trigger Condition | Naming Rule |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `use_mainhand$minecraft:shield`<br/>`use_offhand$minecraft:shield` | Use when holding shield (ID match) | `$` followed by item ID |
| `use_mainhand#minecraft:dirt`<br/>`use_offhand#minecraft:dirt` | Use when holding dirt-type items (tag match) | `#` followed by item tag |

## Swing Animations

**Mainhand swing animations** start with `swing`, **offhand swing animations** start with `swing_offhand`, and both support extension by item ID/tag.

**Special mechanism**: Once triggered, the animation will play to the end and cannot be interrupted midway.

### Custom Swing Animation Example

| Animation Name           | Trigger Condition                       | Naming Rule              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `swing$minecraft:shield` | Left-click swing with shield (ID match) | `$` followed by item ID  |
| `swing#minecraft:dirt`   | Swing with dirt-type items (tag match)  | `#` followed by item tag |

## Hold Animations

Hold animations play when the player is holding an item but not performing any action. **Switching items will restart the animation from the beginning**, so it is recommended to use long-duration loop animations.

- **Mainhand hold** starts with `hold_mainhand`, **offhand hold** starts with `hold_offhand`, and **both can play simultaneously**.
- Supports extension by item ID/tag. Special items (such as charged crossbows) require fixed naming.
