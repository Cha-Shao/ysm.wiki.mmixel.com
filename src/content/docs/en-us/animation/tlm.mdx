Since YSM version 2.4.0, we have added support for the Touhou Little Maid mod. Now, YSM models can be directly used by maids in the Touhou Little Maid mod.

## Adding a New Locator Group

The maid mod has a locator group called `BackpackLocator`, which is used to display the maid's equipped backpack. Its position is usually set between the two shoulders. When the maid's accessory slot is equipped with a Slash Blade or a banner, this locator group is also used as a reference.

## Adding an Animation Locator File

First, you need to add a new type `tlm` to the animation field in `ysm.json`, as shown below:

```json {11}
"animation": {
    "main": "animations/main.animation.json",
    "arm": "animations/arm.animation.json",
    "extra": "animations/extra.animation.json",
    "tac": "animations/tac.animation.json",
    "carryon": "animations/carryon.animation.json",
    "parcool": "animations/parcool.animation.json",
    "swem": "animations/swem.animation.json",
    "slashblade": "animations/slashblade.animation.json",
    // This is the maid animation
    "tlm": "animations/tlm.animation.json"
}
```

After that, just refer to the default model's `tlm.animation.json` animation.

  If the modified maid animation does not work properly, please check whether
  this file is declared here.**

## Animation List

Below are the customizable maid animations. The default model's maid animation file is `tlm.animation.json`:

## Cushion Conditional Animations

The maid mod's cushions all have the same entity ID. For this reason, we have specially added support for conditional animations.

Cushion conditional animations are named starting with `chair`, followed by `$` and the cushion's model ID.

- For example, in-game chair: `chair$touhou_little_maid:class_chair`
- For example, in-game motorcycle cushion: `chair$touhou_little_maid:moto`
