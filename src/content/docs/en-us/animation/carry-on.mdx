title: CarryOn Animation
---

[Carry On mod](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carry-on) is a very interesting mod that allows players to pick up certain blocks, entities, and even other players by holding Shift and right-clicking.

In versions 1.16.5 and 1.18.2, the Carry On mod only supports picking up players and blocks, and will additionally render a player arm model (to disable this rendering, you need to modify the Carry On mod's own configuration file).

**Only the 1.19.2 and 1.20 versions of the Carry On mod can fully support all features!**

The compatible animations for the Carry On mod are stored in a separate file named `carryon.animation.json`, which contains four animations:

| Name               | Function                                                                                                                | Note  |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- |
| `carryon:block`    | Animation when the player is carrying a block                                                                           | Loops |
| `carryon:entity`   | Animation when the player is carrying an entity                                                                         | Loops |
| `carryon:player`   | Animation when the player is carrying another player (only in 1.19.2 and 1.20 versions)                                 | Loops |
| `carryon:princess` | Animation for the player being carried (only in 1.19.2 and 1.20 versions)<br/>!!So the animation is called "princess"!! | Loops |

## Extra Arms

If you are using Carry On mod version 1.18.2 or earlier, you may encounter the following situation:

This is a bug in older versions of the Carry On mod. You just need to manually edit the `config\carryon-client.toml` file and change `true` to `false` after `renderArms`:

```toml {6}
#Settings
[settings]
    #If the front of the Tile Entities should face the player or should face outward
    facePlayer = false
    #Arms should render on sides when carrying
    renderArms = true
```
