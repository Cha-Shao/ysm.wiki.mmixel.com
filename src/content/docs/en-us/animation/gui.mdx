title: GUI Selection Animation
---

Since version 2.2.2, we have added animation support for the model selection GUI. When you hover over, move out, or select a model button in the GUI, the corresponding animation will play.

You can place these animations in the `main.animation.json` file.

## Default Playback Animation

By default, the playback animation for the selection GUI does not have a fixed name. You can create any animation name you like (for example, we name it `gui`), and then modify the `preview_animation` field in the `ysm.json` file to this animation name (as shown below).

```json {4}
{
  "properties": {
    // The preview animation played in the model selection GUI
    "preview_animation": "gui"
  }
}
```

If you are using the BlockBench plugin, just modify it here:

## Other Animations

For specific usage, you can refer to the `main.animation.json` file of the built-in `wine_fox_jk` model.

| Name            | Function                                                 | Note              |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| `hover`         | Plays when the mouse hovers over the model button        | -                 |
| `hover_fadeout` | Plays when the mouse moves out of the model button       | Used for fade-out |
| `focus`         | Plays when the model button is selected (only for 1.20+) | -                 |

## Animation Angle Issue

In version 2.2.2 and earlier, to make the selection GUI animation fit the angle, you needed to set a very strange rotation angle for the character.

Since version 2.3.0, you only need to add the following field under `properties` in the `ysm.json` file to remove this strange rotation angle.

```json {4}
{
  "properties": {
    // Set to true to disable the model selection GUI angle
    "disable_preview_rotation": true
  }
}
```

At this point, the model's front view and the in-game GUI selection angle will be completely consistent!
