Since version 1.2.0, we have added custom arrow functionality, allowing players to modify the arrow model and its animation.

Starting from version 2.2.1, to create a custom arrow, you must declare the relevant files in `ysm.json`, otherwise your changes will not take effect.

<TabItem label="Using the YSM Plugin">

On the plugin's model info page, click the `Arrow Files` option in the sidebar:

On the right, click the button shown in the image to import the corresponding files:

After filling in and confirming the information is correct, click the confirm button below to save:

<TabItem label="Manual Editing">

First, open your model's `ysm.json` file, find the `files` field, and add a new field named `arrow` as shown below:

```json {6-13}
"files": {
    "player": {
        // Player model section
    },
    // Add the arrow model and animation after this
    "arrow": {
        // Arrow model
        "model": "models/arrow.json",
        // Arrow animation
        "animation": "animations/arrow.animation.json",
        // Arrow texture
        "texture": "textures/arrow.png"
    }
}
```

If your arrow texture uses PBR materials, the `texture` field should be filled in as follows:

```json {5-11}
"arrow": {
    "model": "models/arrow.json",
    "animation": "animations/arrow.animation.json",
    // If you want to use PBR, modify as follows
    "texture": {
        // The uv field is required; the following two PBR materials are optional. If not filled, it will be treated as a normal texture.
        "uv": "textures/arrow.png",
        // Oculus and Iris PBR support
        "normal": "textures/arrow_n.png",
        "specular": "textures/arrow_s.png"
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**If you want to create a custom arrow, be sure to fill in this section. If your custom arrow does not work properly, please check whether the relevant files have been declared here.**

## Animation List

Below are the customizable arrow animations. The default model's arrow animation file is `arrow.animation.json`:

| Name                                                   | Function                                                                 |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `water`                                                | Arrow animation in water, high priority, can be overridden by parallel   |
| `fire`                                                 | Arrow on fire animation, high priority, can be overridden by parallel    |
| `ground`                                               | Arrow landing animation, low priority, can be overridden by other anims  |
| `air`                                                  | Arrow flying in air animation, low priority, can be overridden by others |
| `parallel0` <br/>`parallel1` <br/>... <br/>`parallel7` | Parallel animations, high priority, cannot be overridden                 |
