title: Armor Animation
---

Currently, there is no specific location for armor animations; you can place them in the `main.animation.json` file. When a player equips the corresponding armor, the armor animation will play.

To achieve the effect of displaying an animation when armor is equipped, you can follow these steps:

1. In the parallel animation, set the scale of all armor groups to 0;
2. Create specific armor animations and set the scale of the specific group back to 1.

The naming convention for armor animations is almost identical to the hand animations mentioned earlier. Vanilla armor can be divided into four types according to the equipment slot: `head`, `chest`, `legs` (note the plural), and `feet`. All armor animations use these names as prefixes, followed by `$` plus the item ID or `#` plus the item tag to add the armor animation.

Below are some examples of armor animations. You can add as many custom animations as you like:

| Name                                 | Function                                                                                                                                   | Note                                        |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `head$minecraft:iron_helmet`         | Plays this animation when the player equips an item with ID minecraft:iron_helmet in the helmet slot                                       | `$` plus item ID                            |
| `chest$minecraft:diamond_chestplate` | Plays this animation when the player equips an item with ID minecraft:diamond_chestplate in the chestplate slot                            | `$` plus item ID                            |
| `legs#forge:armor/diamond`           | Plays this animation when the player equips an item with the tag forge:armor/diamond in the leggings slot                                  | `#` plus item tag                           |
| `feet#forge:armor/iron`              | Plays this animation when the player equips an item with the tag forge:armor/iron in the boots slot                                        | `#` plus item tag                           |
| `head:default`                       | Plays this animation when the player equips any armor in the helmet slot. This has the lowest priority and can be used as a default effect | Also applies to `chest`, `legs`, and `feet` |
