title: TaCZ Animation
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

[TaCZ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/timeless-and-classic-guns-tac) is a well-crafted firearm mod that supports Forge versions 1.16.5/1.18.2.

[TaCZ: Zero](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/timeless-and-classics-zero) is the higher version sequel, supporting Forge 1.18.2/1.19.2/1.20.1 and Fabric 1.20.1.

We provide support for both versions of the mod.

Currently, firearms are divided into three types: pistol (`pistol`), rifle (`rifle`), and RPG (`rpg`). The animation design uses a combination of upper and lower body, greatly simplifying the animation workflow.

Compatible animations should be placed in the `tac.animation.json` file. When a player holds a firearm from the TaCZ mod, these animations will play.

## Full Body Animations

Since prone or crawling weapon poses cannot use the upper + lower body design, these are designed as full body poses.

| Name                       | Function                        |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------ |

| `tac:climbing:pistol`      | Prone animation for pistol      |
| `tac:climbing:rifle`       | Prone animation for rifle       |
| `tac:climbing:rpg`         | Prone animation for RPG         |

## Grenade Animations

| Name                   | Function                     |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `tac:mainhand:grenade` | Throw grenade with main hand |
| `tac:offhand:grenade`  | Throw grenade with off hand  |

## Special Firearm Animations

All the above animations end with `pistol`, `rifle`, or `rpg`, corresponding to the main weapon categories. If you want to create a unique TAC animation for a specific firearm, just replace the ending `:pistol`, `:rifle`, or `:rpg` with `$` plus the firearm's item ID. For example, to create a unique aim and fire animation for the AK47, name it `tac:aim:fire$tac:ak47`.

<Aside>
  In TaCZ: Zero (TacZ), all firearms are the same item, distinguished by the
  `GunId` field in NBT. We also support this. The usage is the same as above,
  just add the gun ID after `$`.
