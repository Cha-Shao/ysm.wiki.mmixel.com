This tutorial will explain in detail how to convert a Java Edition Yes Steve Model (YSM) mod model pack into a NetEase China Edition Yes Steve Model component add-on.

This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with making Java Edition Yes Steve Model models.

<Aside type="caution">
  Encrypted Java Edition Yes Steve Model models (that is, single files ending
  with `.ysm`) **cannot be read or converted**! If you have not obtained
  permission from the original author for your model, **do not convert or
  distribute it**! We strongly oppose any infringement or theft of models, and
  we are not responsible for any consequences arising from this!
</Aside>

## 1. Preparation

First, you need to download the following two files:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/WiIGQSLgq2A8rdF.png)

- `ysmMain.zip`: This is a prerequisite pack, only for testing the China Edition YSM component add-on. **Do not use it for other purposes**.
- `ysm-netease-utils.js`: This is a BlockBench plugin that can be used to convert Java Edition YSM model packs with one click.

<FileCard
  name="ysm-netease-utils.js"
  size="442 KB"
  url="/files/ysm-netease-utils.js"
/>

Next, your computer also needs to have the following three programs installed:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/p5jxLacNJkVRQgl.png)

- `BlockBench`: A model creation tool, which should be familiar to everyone.
- `VSCode`: A classic text editor. Some advanced features may require editing script files, so it is recommended to install this software.
- `Minecraft Developer Launcher`: This is the official NetEase tool for component development. You need to register a developer account to log in and use it. Download link: [https://mc.163.com/dev](https://mc.163.com/dev)

## 2. Plugin Installation

First, open BlockBench and drag the previously downloaded `ysm-netease-utils.js` file (**do not rename the file, and do not delete it after installation**) directly into BlockBench.
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/1aQ39gqfGRCjrPc.png)
After confirming, you will see the loaded plugin in the `File -> Plugins` menu:

## 3. Model Conversion

Now, let's start converting the Java Edition YSM model.
Open the following menu in BlockBench:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/ailrDY1VGJ8uXfd.png)
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/SI8qWfDuMgdmkn7.png)
Click the `Select Java Edition Model Pack` button, then select the Java Edition YSM model pack folder you want to convert.
Next, click the `Select Export Path` button and choose the path where you want to save the converted component pack.

<Aside>
  The China Edition component pack does not support Chinese characters in the
  path. It is recommended to choose a path with only English characters, such as
  placing it on the desktop.
</Aside>
Finally, fill in the author name and model name. These two names will be automatically
combined by the plugin as your component pack ID. Please choose names that are long
and unlikely to conflict.
<Aside>
  The China Edition component pack does not support IDs containing Chinese
  characters. Please use only lowercase English letters or underscores, and do
  not use Chinese characters or spaces.
</Aside>

## 4. Testing the Model

Now that you have completed the conversion, let's test it in-game!
First, open the `Minecraft Developer Launcher`, log in, and select `Create -> Local Import -> Import Bedrock Component`:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/Spsc9gmIo13udVa.png)
Import the previously downloaded `ysmMain.zip` prerequisite pack, give it any name, and click import.
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/mLuF12gj5IzSJZx.png)
Then, import the folder you just converted using the plugin in the same way:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/xQgAlP5dIvmGfiX.png)
Next, select the main pack (or the add-on pack, as you prefer), and click the development test button:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/JROyAUMZbsta1oE.png)
Choose any version, such as 3.1 or 3.2:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/haFymdDS31AKCMr.png)
On this screen, you need to make two changes:

- Check both the main pack and the add-on pack.
- Select Creative Mode (otherwise, you may be killed by monsters during testing, which is inconvenient).

  Click the start button to run the game, then use the YSM component in-game as usual:

## 5. Feedback

If you encounter problems during use, we may ask you for log files. You can export the log file by clicking here:

## Common Conversion Issues

### 1. Some Errors in the Log

If you see the following errors, they usually do not affect usage and can be ignored:
`friendly name 'material.tohru' not found in entity friendly name list (material.default) - check your spelling?`
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/C4Ncf6ZkIeqmJrn.png)
`Error: can't find animation xxx`
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/jbEFC5zc8LTnGvl.png)

### 2. First-Person Arm Model Has Extra or Missing Parts

The first-person arm model is automatically generated by the plugin by recognizing all subgroups under the `RightArm` group. If you do not have a `RightArm` group, or if the `RightArm` group contains extra bones, you may encounter this issue.
!!(Planned): The plugin will add a new feature in the future to let users select which groups to display!!
Solution:
First, as shown below, find the file in your converted component pack and open it with `VSCode`:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/yIpkr4SGvaRwdCJ.png)
Under the `part_visibility` field, delete any extra groups that should not be displayed. If there are missing groups, you can add them in the same way.

### 3. Some Parts Are Shown in Certain GUIs When They Should Be Hidden

As shown below, some parts that should be hidden are displayed:
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/VvZHTMIfz3ODLhU.png)
![21.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/Dmv6nH5WSFZp2Qo.png)
Solution:
The animation called in these two GUIs is named `paperpoll`. The default `paperpoll` animation generated by the plugin may have some issues. You need to manually fix its content to hide certain components.
Due to Bedrock Edition's mechanism, only the `paperpoll` animation is played in the GUIâ€”**no parallel animations will be played**! Therefore, the animation played in the GUI should not be too complex, and it is not recommended to use `molang` statements, as this may cause the game to lag.
The model file is located at `resource_pack\models\entity`, and the animation file is at `resource_pack\animations`. Usually, you only need to load the file named `main.animation.json`.

![23.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/P38Ks4EwHhCuG2y.png)

### 4. Errors Flood the Log When Opening the GUI Model Switch Screen

The error message may look like: `Error: unhandled request for unknown variable 'variable.xxx'`
![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/01/28/UHCodeBYLnRyIOw.png)
Solution:
GUI and paperdoll animations do not support molang variables. Please check whether your `gui` and `paperdoll` animations contain molang statements.

### 5. Some Model Parts Not Shown in Wheel Animation

If you hide some groups (scale to 0) in the `pre_parallel` animation and want to show them (scale to 1) in the wheel animation, but they do not appear in the wheel animation during testing:
Solution:
Find the keyframes for the group in both the `pre_parallel` and wheel animations, and check if their mode is set to linear. If so, change both to the same smooth frame mode to fix the issue.
The cause of this problem is unclear, but the above method works.
