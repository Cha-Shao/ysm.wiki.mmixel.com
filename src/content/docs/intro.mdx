## Basic Introduction

Yes Steve Model is designed with server communities in mind, featuring many server-friendly designs, including but not limited to:

- Automatic client model sync: When regular players join the server, the server will **automatically** sync models to the player's computer.
- Encrypted model files: All models sent to the client are **encrypted binary files**, effectively preventing model theft!
- Model permission system: Models can be individually authorized. Only after OP enters a command to authorize, can specific models be used.
- Vanilla player model modification: Adds default Steve and Alex models, both of which can automatically use player skins.
- Animation wheel feature: Pressing the `Z` key opens an animation wheel, allowing you to easily play various fun animations (such as actions, expressions, etc.).
- Touhou Little Maid mod rendering support: Using Yes Steve Model 2.4.0 or later and Touhou Little Maid 1.2.0 or later, you can also use corresponding models and animations for maids.

## Platform Support

Versions 1.1.5 and earlier were written in pure Java, supporting the three major platforms and mobile.

Since the old Java encryption was quickly cracked, from version 1.2.0 onwards, the core encryption and rendering parts are all written in C++, greatly improving rendering efficiency and security, but with weaker multi-platform support.

Currently, the client only supports Windows x64 systems, and the server supports Windows and Linux x64 systems. Support for other platforms and architectures is in progress and will be announced as soon as there are updates.
